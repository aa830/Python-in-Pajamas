# Python-in-Pajamas (WIP)
A freeware, open-source program that teaches children the basics of binary, machine language and programming in python; for my High School Computer Science Project


# Dependencies

1. Python3
2. Python libraries (in requirements.txt)
3. Some kind of terminal, command prompt or terminal emulator.


# How does it work?

It uses a minimal amount of 3rd party libraries (hence the requirements.txt) and mostly in-built python libraries to display images and text in a terminal-based GUI.


# Usage

Clone this repository by either clicking the latest published package, or cloning from command line using git.
`git clone https://github.com/aa830/Python-in-Pajamas.git`


You should have an extracted folder called Python-in-Pajamas, inside there is a run.sh or a run.bat script. You may use this to launch the program based on your operating system.

# Installing required libraries

Simply cd into the directory and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
This will install the currently required libraries (pyfiglet, rich, Levenshtein and pillow)

# Note for MacOS users

Please run the following command to make the shell script executable `chmod +x run.sh` (assuming you are already inside the folder)
