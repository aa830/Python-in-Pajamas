# Python-in-Pajamas (WIP)
A freeware, open-source program that teaches children the basics of binary, machine language and programming in python; for my High School Computer Science Project


# How does it work?

It uses a minimal amount of 3rd party libraries (hence the requirements.txt) and mostly in-built python libraries to display images and text in a terminal-based GUI.


# Usage

Clone this repository by either clicking the latest published package, or cloning from command line using git.
'''git clone https://github.com/aa830/Python-in-Pajamas.git'''


#You should have an extracted folder called Python-in-Pajamas, inside there is a run.sh script. You may use this to launch the program. I will add a run.bat file at a later date.
